Congruences Modulo n

1) 3 numbers are read from the standard input: a, b, n; needed for the equation:
  ax = b (mod n)

2) if gcd(a, n) == 1, then we have a solution of the form:
   Xg = a^(-1) * b (mod n)

3) otherwise if gcd(a, n) = d > 1, then we check if b % d == 0 (d must be a divisor of b)
   - if d is not a divisor of b, then we stop the execution of the algorithm, 
     meaning that we haven't found any solution
   - if d is a divisor of b, then we have a solution of the form:
     (a/d) * x = (b/d) * (mod n/d), and Xg = a^(-1) * b (mod n)
     
     - we calculate a^(-1) mod(n) using the extended euclidian algorithm
