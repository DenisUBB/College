Finding a hamiltonian cycle using parallel backtracking:
	- Receives as input the a node
	- A vector of solutions and its bitmap used to remember which node has been visited so far

	We start looking for other nodes from node 0, since we can find a hamiltonian cycle
	from any random node chosen. Each thread tries to visit the neighbours the node of the Node received as parameter,
	one thread from the first neighbour and goes 2 by 2,
