Matrix multiplication of 3 matrixes using a producer/consumer queue:
    - there can be as many producers and consumers, usually divided by 2
    - the CONSUMER is waiting if the queue is empty (until the producer signals him, with a condition variable),
      otherwise it gets an element from the queue and consumes it
    - the element from the queue is a line, and the result from R1 = A * B, and now it will calculate R2 = R1 * C 

    - the PRODUCER performs matrix multiplication between matrix A and B, and stores the result in R1
    - if the number of lines processed reaches the end of the matrixes, the producers is signaled to stop
    - for every line calculated, we push its index in the queue and notify the waiting producers
