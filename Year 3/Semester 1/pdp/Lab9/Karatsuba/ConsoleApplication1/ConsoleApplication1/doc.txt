Karatsuba using MPI

Masters sends a chunk from A to workers and whole vector B. 
Will perform karatsuba between (A[i], A[i+1], A[i+2],..., A[i + k]) * (B[0], B[1], ... , B[k])

Workers will receive a part and will calculate the chunk received from A * B using karatsuba. It will store the result in a vector of res.
It will send back to the master the vector it calculated (res).

Masters receives the results back from workers, and adds the values received to a vector of final results.
