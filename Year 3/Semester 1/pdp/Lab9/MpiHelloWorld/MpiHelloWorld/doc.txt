Polynomial multiplication using MPI
Master sends the whole array A and B to the workers

The workers receive the array and start doing polynomial multiplication, starting to calculate from coefficient = worker_id, 
skipping T elements every time until a new one is pick, operation performed until the end of the array.

The worker sends back the result to the master, and the master adds the results to a final array
