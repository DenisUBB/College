Parallel algorithm of prefix sum using 4 logical processors
    - having a precomputed matrix(log n) with the addition of [k - 1][i + 2 ^ j], it's easy to calculate every element
      from the first line (our array): gPrecalculatedMatrix[0][i] = a. For each line, log n additions are performed between 
      the element above and a power of 2

    - each thread does k elements 0 <= k <= n (where k = k + NoOfLogicalProcessors)

    - now we use the precomputed matrix to calculate final parallel result (having a 2^j <= i + 1), and j represents
      the line of the precomputed matrix in this case
