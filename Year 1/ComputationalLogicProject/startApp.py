#    - for eclipse idle press f9 to run the program
#    - for python idle press f5 to run the program

#
#    Additions to the original problem:
#        - multiplication works and also when secondNr is bigger than one digit (will be found in controller with name mul, not implemented in the menu)
#        - the method of successive divisions work in both cases ( when source base is bigger than destination base and vice-versa)
